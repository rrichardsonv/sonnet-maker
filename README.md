### Sonnet Maker

Builds sonnets from supplied text file using nltk

The main goal of this project is becoming more familiar with python and the functionality of nltk

To setup:
  grammar_dictionary_builder.py
  grammar_dictionary_sorter.py (will take a little while)
  my_grammar.py (to see verb clusters!)

coming soon:
  Subjects to go with those predicates haha
