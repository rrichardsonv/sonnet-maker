### Sonnet Maker
*****

Builds sonnets from 2of12.txt ~~supplied text file~~ using nltk

### Goals
The main goal of this project is becoming more familiar with python and the functionality of nltk.

The secondary goal has been to laugh at how bad computers are at poetry.


### Challenges
  1.  minor existential crises at my program being mean to me. It was an easy bugfix but an entire sonnet composed of 'you should die.' was very disconcerting

  2.  Grammar, wow, grammar is hard. Ended up using many MANY dicts as sets for the variety of ways that english verb conjugations behave illogically

  3.  Tuples vs Lists, hugely helpful when I finally read the description of Tuples ~= structs and Lists ~= arrays. Really needed that.
